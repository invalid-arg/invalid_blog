	<h2>Blog Post One</h2>
	<p>Hey, so I bet your already thinking 'Well this is a crap looking blog'. Well it is, but hopefully not for long. You see for a while now I've been wanting to learn how to code in node.js and I figured the best way to start was to write a simple blogging engine (original eh?). So over the coming weeks and months this blog will hopefully start to look a little better, behave a little better and I might learn something on the way.</p>
	<p>For a first post I thought it would be a good idea if I detailed the technologies I'm going to be using. None of the choices are based on practicality or suitability. Just purely on my need to learn something new. So here's the list:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://node.js.org" title="node.js">node.js</a> - This seems to be all the rage at the moment and recently I've become a fan of JavaScript, so I thought I'd give it a go. To be honest I'm probably never going to step away from my roots in C#, but I believe there is great benefit to learning new languages.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org" title="MongoDB">mongodb</a> - It seems mongodb is the defacto choice of storage when using node.js. There may be better alternatives out there but from what I can determine this is as good a choice as any to get my head around nosql.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/" title="Windows Azure: Microsoft's Cloud Platform | Cloud Hosting | Cloud Services">Windows Azure</a> - I travelled down to London a few weeks back for an Azure conference and I have to say I was impressed. It was a bit of a promotion so I took everything with a pinch of salt but you can't argue with the cost savings and simplicity in which they seemed to set things up. Wether this measures up in practice is yet to be to seen.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>As well as the development stack I'm going to be using a couple of other tools:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macbookair/" title="Apple (United Kingdom) - MacBook Air - The ultimate everyday notebook.">My mac</a> - Being a C# guy I do all my work on a windows pc. Time for this to change.</li>
			<li><a href="http://macromates.com" title="TextMate â€” The Missing Editor for Mac OS X">TextMate</a> - Again C# pretty much means you're using Visual Studio. Its pretty complex, so I thought I'd go lightweight on this one.
			<li><a href="https://github.com">github</a> - During the azure talk in London they mentioned how well it integrated with github... lets see.</li>
			<li><a href="http://html5.org" title="html5.org &mdash; HTML revisited">html5</a> - not really a tool, but I'm going to try and make the most of it.</li>
			<li>And finally, a spell checker. My spelling is atrocious.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So I guess there is nothing else to do other than get started.</p>
